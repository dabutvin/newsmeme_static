	<meta itemprop="description" content="Paris just announced plans to ban all pre-1997 model automobiles from driving in the city center on weekdays. Ban was conceived not by the fashion police, but as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce air pollution &amp; smog in the French capital. While older vehicles represent approximately 10% of the city’s vehicle stock, they account for nearly 50% of all emissions in Paris.
