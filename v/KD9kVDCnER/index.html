	<meta itemprop="description" content="Snapchat has got an update that further expands its popular Face Swap feature. While until now the Face Swap feature allowed users to swap their faces in the snaps taken only with the person standing right next to them, from now they can swap their faces with just anyone who&#39;s image has been saved in their Camera Roll. This means users no longer have to awkwardly pose with friends for photos they want to swap faces.">
